# Customized_Virtual_File_System
Name of The Project 
=> CVFS - customized virtual file system. This project is to emulate all functionalities
provided by File Systems 

Description of the project
=> 1) In this project we emulate all data stuctures which are used by operating systems 
to manage File system oriented tasks.
   2) As the name suggests its virtual because we maintain all records in primary storage or RAM
   3) In this project we created all data structures which is required for for file 
    subsystems as Inode, Inode Table, File table, UAREA, User File Descriptor table, 
   SuperBLock, Data Block Boot Block etc.
   4) We provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File
   subsystem as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, Rm, ls, stat, Fstat and Backup
   5) While providing the implementation of all above functionality we use our own 
   data structures by reffering Algorithms of UNIX Operating System
   6) By using this project we can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any Platform

Platform Required
=> Windows NT Platform OR Linux Distributions 

Architectural requirement 
=> intel 32 bit Processors

User Interface 
=> Command Line Inteface

Technology used
=> System Programming Using C

Data Structures Used in this project 
=> We have used Array in UFDT and LinkedList in DILB
